Create a console application that will function as a mock bank using solely Java 1.8. Persist your data in a text file (username, password, account balance, etc.). You may also write functionality to serialize your bank after every transaction but this is not a requirement.

As a user, I can:
create an account with a unique email or username, along with a password (for this first iteration, multiple users need not be accommodated) 
log in 
log out
deposit money
withdraw money
view balance

To note: 
There are no strict requirements regarding the flow of operation for your program, but keep the user in mind. Is your menu clear? Is user input validated? Do I have to log back in after each transaction? All important things to consider.
Another thing to note is the organization of the application. Keep in mind separation of concerns. I would suggest having a class for console input/output, having a class to perform the business logic of the application, and having a class which handles persistence of data (this will be especially helpful because it will allow you to change out this persistence layer with JDBC code without affecting the rest of the code)
