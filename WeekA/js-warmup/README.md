# JavaScript Warm Up

- the exercises here will be printing to the console
- in order to take a look at what JavaScript is printing to the console
    - open an HTML file in your browser  
    - this HTML file should have a script tag, either including or referencing your js code 
    - use Ctrl+Shift+I (or Right Click -> Inspect in Chrome) to open developer tools 
    - from here you should be able to see your console, and anything printed to it
- JavaScript can also be written directly into the console (open the console and try declaring a variable or function), so you can also test out simple code here as well

Once you have your HTML file set up with its associated script, make sure you feel comfortable doing the following:

1. Use the console log function to write "hello world" to the console.

2. Declare a variable, x, and assign it a numeric value. Write an if statement which evaluates the condition of whether x is greater than 10. If it is, write "x is greater than 10" to the console. If it is not, write "x is equal to or less than 10." 

3. Using a for loop, print "greetings" to the console 4 times.

4. Using a while loop, print "greetings" to the console 4 times

5. Declare a variable, color. Create a switch statement which evaluates the color variable. The values we would general expect are green, purple, and orange. If any of these cases are met, the two colors which make them up should be printed to the console. (e.g. if color is "orange" -> "yellow and red" is printed to the console) If the value of "color" is not one of those three options, "color unknown" should be printed to the console.

6. Write a function, "printNums" which takes no arguments and prints each number from 1 to 10 to the console, each number printing on a new line.

7. Write a function, "printUpToVal" which takes one numeric argument and prints each number from 1 up to that number. 

8. Write a function "printRange" which takes two numeric arguments and prints each number from the first value to the second value.

9. Write a function "printString" which takes two arguments. The first argument should be a string, and the second should be a number. The function should return a string of the original string parameter concatinated the number of times provided by second parameter (ex. print("hello",5) returns "hellohellohellohellohello").


Each exercise in the js file is commented out with multiline comments - remove the comment, save the file and refresh the HTML file to execute it.
