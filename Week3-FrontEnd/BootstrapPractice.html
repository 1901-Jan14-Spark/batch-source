            <p>If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Poor old tree. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. There are no limits in this world. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Get tough with it, get strong. Little short strokes. Let's do that again.</p>

            <p>Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. This is the fun part We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You can do it. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>
            
            <p>Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Here we're limited by the time we have. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Imagination is the key to painting. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.</p>
            
            <p>That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. Don't fiddle with it all day. Learn when to stop.</p>
